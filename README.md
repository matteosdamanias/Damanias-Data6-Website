# A little bit about me!
<hr>

## Hi! My name is **Matteos Damanias**, and before coming to Berkeley, I used to live in Buellton, California. 
My hometown is a small area somewhat near Santa Barbara, with the main highschool, Santa Ynez High, only having 908 students. My wonderful family has mixed Italian, Ethiopian, and American heritage, and the person I am today is a result of watching their wild personalities collide and yet coexist. Even when they disagreeed, they always encouraged me to be myself and to adhere to universal values of empathy and respect, and I carry those with me to this day. 


While there weren't a lot of academic opportunites to take advantage of back home, I still tried my best to participate in what I could. 
I was Senior Class President, and part of the robotics team, environmental club, journalist group, and Youth and Government outfit, among other things. My favorite experiences from that time would have to be debating in the state capitol for YnG, and working as a on-site camp mentor for Camp Whittier Science Camp. 

It's probably pretty clear that I love going to new places and trying new things, but among my older and more specific hobbies are hiking, fishing, reading, and having fun conversations with people (if that counts). I absolutely love hanging out with small groups of people, and think that everyone should try to have an in-depth or intimate conversation with someone at least once per day. 

Thus far, I've truly enjoyed Berkeley as a prospective **Civil Engineering major** for the *class of '27*, and am grateful to say that nearly everyone I've met has been a joy to talk to. If you want to talk about anything, feel free to reach out on snap to *m4tteos*

Now for a photo drop. . .
